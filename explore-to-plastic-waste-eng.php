                  <h3>How to avoid plastic waste</h3>
                  <h4>Plastic waste and your business</h4>
                  <p>Plastic products and plastic packaging play an important role in maintaining hygiene in  gastronomy,  as  they  protect  food,  ensure  food  safety  and  improve  shelf  life.  However,  both  the  production  and  disposal  of  plastic  and  single-use  packaging  require resources and have a negative impact on the environment. At the same time, worldwide  regulations  regarding  Single  Use  Plastics  (SUP’s)  are  increasing.  That  is  why  we  must  support  our  HoReCa  customers  to  use  alternatives  and  dispose  of  plastics  properly.  Businesses  can  generate  costs  from  not  managing  plastic  waste  properly. But by doing things differently restaurants can show their customers that they care about the environment and wellbeing of their communities<span id="dots"></span>

                            <h3>The impact of gastronomy on the plastic waste challenge</h3>
                            <p>We  must  act  now:  the  pollution  of  our  oceans  from  plastic  waste  has  reached  dramatic  proportions.  Even  today,  a  truckload of plastic waste on average ends up in the ocean every minute. If you can picture this, then it should be clear to  you  that  we  must  act  immediately!  With  your  gastronomy  business,  you  can  make  an  important  contribution  to  sustainable development, because your business is closely tied to people and the environment. You may notice plastic waste floating around your local environment and this is something that consumers and the younger generation are no longer tolerating.</p>

                                  <h3>How to prevent plastic waste</h3>
                                  <p>There are many ways of reducing plastic. The gastronomy sector has many reusable, recyclable and compostable alternatives. National laws on mandatory reuse systems for gastronomy are coming into effect, for example in Germany or France. This means that the HoReCa sector will soon have a future without single-use plastics. When you want to tackle your plastic waste, it helps to know what the different sources of plastics are, how they are used, how to dispose them and what the available alternatives are.</p>

                                                <p>It contains substances called phthalates, which are added to the PVC to make it flexible but these chemicals and dioxins leach into the environment through incineration. Their potential negative impact on human health is a concern and is not fully understood. In addition, PVC is also difficult to recycle. Today less than 1% of PVC is recycled and this is problematic for future recycling targets in Europe. Look at the packaging on products you purchase – try to avoid packaging with the recycling logo number 3 which is a sign for PVC and favour packaging where “PVC free” is communicated.</p>

                        <p>Once you have taken some steps, check the cut down of your food waste and keep a track of it. Look out for simple tracking solutions that don’t need too much input from you, for example, monitor your disposal costs, the volume of donations, the win back of sunk costs (by Food surplus redistribution), and the attraction of new customers. Talk to your staff about how much you saved and how they have helped in achieving the desired results. Seeing the progress visibly can motivate them to keep on saving food. Publicise what you are doing. For example, a message on your website or in your menu can be a visible reminder to your customers about your responsible actions. You can have an impact this way as staff and customers will take these messages home with them.</p>
