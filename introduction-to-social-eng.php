                    <h3>THE <br>GREATER <br>IMPACT </h3>

                <div class="right-content">
                    <p>Because the gastronomy industry is such a big employer, every size
                        and type of restaurant has a crucial role to play as a contributor to the
                        economy and in their local community. But unfortunately, many
                        businesses in the hospitality and food industry still don’t comply with
                        the law, lack basic good practices and sometimes even the
                        knowledge of what is needed. Employees whose basic rights are not
                        protected have a negative effect not just on the business but on the
                        surrounding community. The efficiency of an operation, the quality of
                        food and the overall business success is completely reliant on
                        committed staff.

                    KNOW HOW – STEPS TO<br>ACT SOCIALLY
                </h3>
                <p>To be a sustainable and socially engaged employer, comply with your
                    national employment legislation and uphold the basic human rights of
                    your employees. By respecting those rights, you ensure fair terms and
                    conditions of employment for your staff. This can be done by
                    engaging with your employees, such as identifying necessary health
                    and safety measures and keeping an eye on their working hours. Go
                    further by asking for fair working conditions even for your suppliers’
                    employees to make an impact on the level of your supply chain. For
                    example, do they have a code of conduct for their ethical business
                    conduct? Get involved in your local community to be fully integrated
                    by, for example, hiring local employees and people with different
                    social backgrounds, cultures, and histories including migrants.</p>
